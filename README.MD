# JavaScript-Core-3-Coursework-Week1-London8

The exercises are split into two folders: `mandatory` and `extra`.

All projects in `mandatory` folder **must** be completed for homework. There are 3 subfolders in this folder. `debugging-practice` is a debugging exxercise. `thinking-like-a-programmer` has a `task.md` file which gives you some insight into the debugging process. `project` contains a `task.md` file which gives you link to the project details and tells you how to set up the project.

As this is a challenging project, it is strongly advised that you start on it early.

The `extra` folder contains exercises that you can complete to challenge yourself, but are not required.
